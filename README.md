## Pull requests accepted

It would be cool if someone designed awesome card backs for black and white DAH cards.
Obviously many more awesome cards could be created. Pull requests aren't
necessary for adding cards; you can just edit the spreadsheet. If you want
to add anything else to make this more fun, though, I'm happy to check it out.
